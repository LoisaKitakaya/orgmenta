// Placeholder for phase 2.

// We need to integrate with POS systems (e.g. square?)
// We might just get away with something like this: www.paidforstripe.com
// (That's a small startup, there are plenty more established.)
// (Possibly better to approach someone like www.paidforstripe.com for them to integrate with us? but see nfc.tsx.)
// Then a later feature can be to start implemneting integrations with POS sytems and hardware like square/block

// uses:
// stripe.tsx
// nfc.tsx
// etc.
