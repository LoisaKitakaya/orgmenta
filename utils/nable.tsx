// Placeholder
// RMM tool to integrate with.
// Priority 3.

// Official API (unsure if there is anything other than powershell that we can integrate with. May need to contact them for proper API access for partner integration)
// https://documentation.n-able.com/N-central/userguide/Content/Further_Reading/API_Level_Integration/API_Integration_Introduction.html
// https://documentation.n-able.com/N-central/userguide/Content/Further_Reading/API_Level_Integration/API_Integration_WebServiceLevel.html
// 
// Unofficial API for scripts etc.: https://github.com/N-able

// We will eventually a) use the official API to offer integration with this RMM (configs, agreements etc.) and b) use the unofficial api to allow scripts to be deployed to agents etc.
// Note that there are TWO n-able products - one is more full-featured than the other.
