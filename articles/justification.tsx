// This is currently a 'shot across the bow'. May need to tune it down, else explicitly acknowledge that it is such.
// Perhaps this is a call to action.
// Shame on:
// https://www.ninjaone.com/pricing/
// CW
// Autotask
// et al.

// If it is a call to action / shot across the bow, then it also acts as accountability for us.
// If we fail in any of these things, then we should be called out on it.

// Well done: 
// Halo: 
// - transparent pricing, 
// - optional (I believe) set up fee.
// - Optional demo, not mandatory
// - Free trial.
